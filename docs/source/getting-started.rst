Getting Started
===============

| **Welcome to Megu!**
| This page should hopefully provide you with enough information to get you started using Megu.

Installation and Setup
======================

Installing the package should be super duper simple as we utilize Python's setuptools.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ poetry add megu
   $ # or if you're old school...
   $ pip install megu

Or you can build and install the package from the git repo.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/stephen-bunn/megu.git
   $ cd ./megu
   $ python setup.py install
